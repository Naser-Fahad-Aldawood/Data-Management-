# Data-Management

<h1>Eloitte Project </h1>

As a student part of the <b>SDAIA Bootcamp for Data Management</b>, I was tasked with a mandatory capstone project. The focal point of my project was the development of a robust data sharing framework tailored for fintech companies, ensuring alignment with the regulations set by Sama and PDPL. 

<h3>The project consisted of four key deliverables: </h3>

<b>* a visually intuitive Data Sharing Framework map</b>.

<b>* a comprehensive Policy and Procedures document</b>.

<b>* an Excel file detailing the alignment between Sama and PDPL articles</b>.  

<b>* a visually informative Data Flow Chart. Additionally, a RACI Matrix was implemented to ensure clear role distribution</b>.
